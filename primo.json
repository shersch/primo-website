Anyway, I really wanted to deploy GitLab in a container, but there really isn't a lot of support for it in AWS. So after some trial and failure, I resigned to doing it the old fashioned way: EC2. Although the database is on RDS of course. For now, there is an EC2 instance that runs GitLab, and an EC2 instance that runs the GitLab Runner. They are able to communicate over HTTPS. Because we plan on using GitLab Pipelines to deploy infrastructure to CloudFlare\n\n"}}},"page":"0781eebe-cfab-4b04-ad03-bdc2dace8aae","symbol":"e6a7486a-f1e4-41bb-9abf-4671cd3c35ee","index":2},{"id":"6c1a30c3-b3c4-4c68-bc72-7dbe43270895","content":{"en":{"email":"","heading":"","social_links":[{"icon":"mdi:twitter","link":{"url":"https://twitter.com","label":"Twitter","active":false}},{"icon":"mdi:github","link":{"url":"https://github.com","label":"Github","active":false}}]}},"page":"0781eebe-cfab-4b04-ad03-bdc2dace8aae","symbol":"dd3883ac-0f40-4f01-95bc-6b80621f085f","index":3},{"id":"a9620b69-b8e1-4c4e-90de-7bdf289ec09a","content":{"en":{"logo":{"image":{"alt":"","src":"","url":"","size":null},"title":"corta"},"site_nav":[{"link":{"url":"http://localhost:5173/","label":"Home"}},{"link":{"url":"http://localhost:5173/article-list","label":"Blog"}},{"link":{"url":"http://localhost:5173/article-list","label":"About"}}]}},"page":"35f165d1-01a9-4027-b55b-80bb963e99b0","symbol":"6c84ead0-6d66-4730-930a-657e6cac9e41","index":0},{"id":"c270172b-bc6d-4ae7-850c-5f1998a4230d","content":{"en":{"image":{"alt":"","src":"https://kghwomtndmlhmwefzour.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/4463e179-86de-40c7-9a94-61d251468dc2/1690040661822synology.png","url":"https://kghwomtndmlhmwefzour.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/4463e179-86de-40c7-9a94-61d251468dc2/1690040661822synology.png","size":1090},"heading":"The State of Synology","superhead":"JULY 23, 2023 "}},"page":"35f165d1-01a9-4027-b55b-80bb963e99b0","symbol":"040954db-b008-45f9-961f-22f910908806","index":1},{"id":"ceba82b6-0992-4b2d-9ae8-437181dee92f","content":{"en":{"content":{"html":"<p>Synology and I first crossed paths around 2014 or 2015.

However, fresh into the workforce, newly married, and saving for a house meant a Synology device, along with hard drives, was a distant dream. Thus, my journey around this tech took a detour.

It came loaded with some amazing and useful features: DDNS, VPN server, Docker, and Let's Encrypt, not to mention their stellar suite of apps like Synology Drive, Synology Office, DS Video, DS Photo (now Synology Photos), and many more.

I sought more from my Synology, but it felt like Synology was the one holding me back. At the time, I still needed more storage, and more CPU, so the upgrade to the DS1821+ was necessary.  Regardless of which device I was using, DSM is DSM, and the difficulties were the same.  The friction started with SSL certificates. If you wished to use a wildcard certificate, you could only do it with Synology's pre-loaded domain, not your custom one. The reasoning behind such a limitation remains elusive to me, and it forced me to find a workaround. Eventually, I landed on the <a href=\"https://fleet.linuxserver.io/image?name=linuxserver/swag\">SWAG Docker container from LinuxServer.io</a>. This solution addressed my SSL certificate issue, but it led me to abandon Synology's built-in reverse proxy and pen a myriad of Nginx config files. The built-in reverse proxy lacked support for advanced configurations, but it was fulfilling its role, and the SWAG container demanded more work than I'd hoped for. Thankfully, I later discovered <a href=\"https://nginxproxymanager.com/\">NGINX Proxy Manager</a>, though it brought its own set of complications that I won't get into here.</p>\n<p>NGINX Proxy Manager (NPM) works like a dream when it comes to setting up a reverse proxy and an SSL certificate. Yet, Synology reserves ports 80 and 443 for its own purposes. I could've chosen different ports and rerouted all port 80 and 443 requests on my router to the varied ports on the Synology, but I wasn't keen on it. After some fiddling, I shifted Synology's reserved ports from 80 and 443 to 81 and 444, respectively, and NPM started running smoothly. This needs to be done after every Synology update though, so using different ports might have been a better option.</p>\n<p>The most significant gripe I had was with Docker. I haven't used Synology's native Docker UI in years because it's not compatible with the features I use. Instead of ignoring those features, it disrupts the UI's functioning. Any modifications made in the UI would fail to preserve the unsupported configuration, thus disrupting my containers. To be precise, if you want anything more than using a bridge or host network, it will cause the UI to malfunction. When I sought to use one container as a VPN gateway for another container or when I wanted to use a Macvlan network to provide a container with its local IP address, it caused the UI to falter. The command-line interface (CLI) was my go-to for most tasks, but it would have been convenient to monitor my containers using the UI. I've been using <a href=\"https://www.portainer.io/\">Portainer</a> for the past few years, and it's been fantastic. It even resolves another significant issue Synology imposed on Docker users: the API. By restricting the API access, Synology diminished Docker's power user experience. However, Portainer has its own API, providing an easy workaround if you use it to manage your containers.</p>\n<p>Using a container as a VPN gateway for another container proved more challenging than anticipated. As predicted, this configuration disrupted the Docker UI, and it just didn't function. It failed because the TUN kernel module wasn't loaded. I had to set up a task to load the TUN kernel module on boot. And yes, it must run on boot since every time you restart your Synology, this configuration doesn't persist.</p>\n<p>Hopefully, I've painted a clear picture. DSM7.2 was released recently, featuring a new Docker UI called \"Container Manager\". However, I'll never know if it works, as I use containers as network devices and use Macvlan networks.

An SSH warning into your Synology is acceptable, but why can't I just have a warning about exposing my Docker API or that Macvlan networks are unsupported? I'm not asking Synology to adjust their platform to cater to these extended use cases, but I think they should take a step back.

The command option allows Portainer to interact with the Docker daemon running on the host machine (in this case, the Synology). It accomplishes this by utilizing the -H unix:///var/run/docker.sock argument, which instructs Portainer to connect directly to the Docker daemon. This connection is feasible because we've mapped the Docker socket file in the volumes section. This mapping makes the Docker socket file from the host machine accessible to the Portainer container, enabling direct communication between Portainer and the Docker daemon.  Now, if you're not using the <code>/volume1/docker/portainer</code> directory that I suggested earlier, you will need to update this configuration to reflect the directory of your choice.  And finally, let's review the port mapping.  Port 8000 is used for Portainer's \"edge compute\" functions, so you most likely can delete that line unless you are deliberately planning to use those features.  Of course, you can add it back later if you want.  Port 9000 serves up the Portainer UI over HTTP.  This is regarded as \"legacy\" because they encourage you to use an encrypted connection, but if your SSL termination is done via an external proxy, you may want to use this.  Port 9443 is where the UI is served via HTTPS.  You can use Portainer's UI for your SSL encryption if you choose, but I will continue under the assumption that SSL will be handled through a third party tool like Nginx Proxy Manager or SWAG from Linuxserver.io.  Therefore, port 9000 is really the only one we need.</p>\n<h3 id=\"licensing\">Licensing</h3>\n<p>This is mostly irrelevant, but Portainer does offer a free enterprise license for users that run 5 or fewer instances of Portainer.
