                <p>Synology and I first crossed paths around 2014 or 2015. Even without having laid eyes on its operating system, I was enamored by its sleek form factor. At that time, I didn't have space for a 42U server rack at home, so it seemed like a flawless solution for data storage. However, fresh into the workforce, newly married, and saving for a house meant a Synology device, along with hard drives, was a distant dream. Thus, my journey around this tech took a detour. I worked my way through tons of random hardware over the next few years. I'll spare the details of the several machines that came and went along with a 42U server rack that I really didn't need. An important thing to note here though, was that in the couple of years leading up to 2018, I went from running several servers and VMs into just needing one server with Docker on it. So it was time to finally pony up the dough and get myself a Synology.</p>
                <p>I began with a DS918+, and I couldn't have been more thrilled. If I recall correctly, it was the summer of 2018 when I bought it. I had spent a great deal of time working on my friend Nate's DS1815+, so I knew from the moment it arrived how I wanted to set it up. So I filled it with 4x 2TB WD Reds (CMR), and my journey began. It came loaded with some amazing and useful features: DDNS, VPN server, Docker, and Let's Encrypt, not to mention their stellar suite of apps like Synology Drive, Synology Office, DS Video, DS Photo (now Synology Photos), and many more. DSM developers had truly considered all angles, and I was overjoyed by its ease of use. I was so delighted that I later upgraded to the DS1821+.</p>
                <p>But then, our paths began to diverge.</p>
                <p>Before upgrading to DS1821+, tension was already mounting between DSM and me. I sought more from my Synology, but it felt like Synology was the one holding me back. At the time, I still needed more storage, and more CPU, so the upgrade to the DS1821+ was necessary. Regardless of which device I was using, DSM is DSM, and the difficulties were the same. The friction started with SSL certificates. If you wished to use a wildcard certificate, you could only do it with Synology's pre-loaded domain, not your custom one. The reasoning behind such a limitation remains elusive to me, and it forced me to find a workaround. Eventually, I landed on the <a href="https://fleet.linuxserver.io/image?name=linuxserver/swag">SWAG Docker container from LinuxServer.io</a>. This solution addressed my SSL certificate issue, but it led me to abandon Synology's built-in reverse proxy and pen a myriad of Nginx config files. The built-in reverse proxy lacked support for advanced configurations, but it was fulfilling its role, and the SWAG container demanded more work than I'd hoped for. Thankfully, I later discovered <a href="https://nginxproxymanager.com/">NGINX Proxy Manager</a>, though it brought its own set of complications that I won't get into here.</p>
                <p>NGINX Proxy Manager (NPM) works like a dream when it comes to setting up a reverse proxy and an SSL certificate. Yet, Synology reserves ports 80 and 443 for its own purposes. I could've chosen different ports and rerouted all port 80 and 443 requests on my router to the varied ports on the Synology, but I wasn't keen on it. After some fiddling, I shifted Synology's reserved ports from 80 and 443 to 81 and 444, respectively, and NPM started running smoothly. This needs to be done after every Synology update though, so using different ports might have been a better option.</p>
                <p>The most significant gripe I had was with Docker. I haven't used Synology's native Docker UI in years because it's not compatible with the features I use. Instead of ignoring those features, it disrupts the UI's functioning. Any modifications made in the UI would fail to preserve the unsupported configuration, thus disrupting my containers. To be precise, if you want anything more than using a bridge or host network, it will cause the UI to malfunction. When I sought to use one container as a VPN gateway for another container or when I wanted to use a Macvlan network to provide a container with its local IP address, it caused the UI to falter. The command-line interface (CLI) was my go-to for most tasks, but it would have been convenient to monitor my containers using the UI. I've been using <a href="https://www.portainer.io/">Portainer</a> for the past few years, and it's been fantastic. It even resolves another significant issue Synology imposed on Docker users: the API. By restricting the API access, Synology diminished Docker's power user experience. However, Portainer has its own API, providing an easy workaround if you use it to manage your containers.</p>
                <p>Using a container as a VPN gateway for another container proved more challenging than anticipated. As predicted, this configuration disrupted the Docker UI, and it just didn't function. It failed because the TUN kernel module wasn't loaded. I had to set up a task to load the TUN kernel module on boot. And yes, it must run on boot since every time you restart your Synology, this configuration doesn't persist.</p>
                <p>Hopefully, I've painted a clear picture. DSM7.2 was released recently, featuring a new Docker UI called "Container Manager". However, I'll never know if it works, as I use containers as network devices and use Macvlan networks. I don't want to risk damaging my configuration to see if Synology has improved the Docker experience.</p>
                <p>While I understand that the things I'm trying to achieve aren't supported, and I'm pushing the device's limits, what baffles me is why Synology would purposely impede my progress. An SSH warning into your Synology is acceptable, but why can't I just have a warning about exposing my Docker API or that Macvlan networks are unsupported? I'm not asking Synology to adjust their platform to cater to these extended use cases, but I think they should take a step back. Even MacOS doesn't obstruct me when I want to do things it dislikes.</p>
                <p>In conclusion, the DS1821+ will be my last Synology. As they continue to tighten the screws and veer towards vendor lock-in, it's becoming less appealing. Many of the features and functions I wanted most in DSM appear half-baked and not sturdy enough to prevent me from resorting to third-party applications. The thought of upgrading to a costlier, more powerful device only to face these same issues and then being compelled to buy their expensive proprietary hard drives is unimaginable. It seems like Synology is entering a weird phase where they're pricing themselves out of home labs while simultaneously nerfing their features to a point where they wouldn't work in an enterprise environment. Is small business where they're finding their sweet spot?</p><!-- HTML_TAG_END -->
